1,Under the Shade of a Tree,Under the Shade of a Tree,"Under the Shade of a Tree is a curatorial platform to host sound walks that focus on the history of the specific site, its biodiversity, and the challenges the site faces due to climate change and over-development.",/assets/under_1.jpg,"Any site is the confluence of many voices, both human and non-human, and being able to listen to them is a step towards empathy. Under the Shade of a Tree is an online platform that allows artists, activists and other collaborators to geo-tag audio recordings to be heard at specific locations and be guided by simulated non-human narrators to include perspectives that do not always find representation in the anthropocene. Initiated by site-specific interventions at San Marcos, Texas and the Theosophical Society, Chennai, this project hopes to convene culture-specific experiences, both ecological and human, to provoke dialogue around climate action beyond human constraints.","Anish Cherian (India), Holly Veselka (USA)",Andrew McWilliams (USA),https://befantastic.in/together/under-the-shade-of-a-tree
2,Supratrajectory,Ground Control,Supratrajectory is an immersive experience that speculates a future where human inaction against climate change renders Earth uninhabitable. The search for a new home compels scientists to turn to emotionally intelligent space probes to locate habitable exoplanets amongst the stars.,/assets/supra_1.jpg,"Where will our collective (in)action leave humanity and will the lucky few be forced to abandon Earth for a better alternative amongst the stars? Supratrajectory uses machine learning and interactivity to bring audiences on a speculative journey into the future. The installation invites viewers to contemplate - within a 360° projection space - the destructive trajectory that technological progress has placed humanity on. Spread across four acts, it explores a future in which continued human existence (of the privileged) relies on discovering potentially habitable planets. The narrative visuals use AI generated satellite imagery, a generative audio soundtrack and LED pillar monoliths.","Gaetan Boisson (Singapore), Kapilan Naidu (Singapore), Sarwesh Shah (India)",Ellen Pearlman (USA),https://befantastic.in/together/supratrajectory
3,a silent scream,a silent scream,"Interrogating humanity’s perception of climate change, animal cruelty and the impending extinction crisis, the project uses film and facial expressions to guide its audience’s experience. Using AI, this exhibition attempts to inspect one’s own emotional reactions to the climate crisis.",/assets/asile_1.jpg,"Through a mixture of film and machine learning art experiences, the exhibition highlights the importance of raising awareness of climate change. Using facial expression recognition as an art expression, this exhibition provides an experience that incorporates the viewer’s ways of seeing how their facial expressions categorized into calm and agitated states influence their perception of reality to the species crisis.","Amanda Chen (Singapore), Elly Cho (South Korea), Iskandar Goh (Singapore), Subhash Maskara (India), Suma Dodmani (India); Supported by: Padmanabhan J (India)",Marc Lee (Switzerland),https://befantastic.in/together/a-silent-scream
4,Climate Pieta,Climate Pieta,Can conversations mediated through AI and art change the way the religious and the non-religious engage with sorrows arising from the climate crisis? Can they evoke that much needed pieta to bring the climate transformation?,/assets/clima_1.png,"Climate Change is a collective experience, yet the response to the crisis has been extremely fragmented. While communicating to the public, would it be prudent for Climate Activists to use faith as an axis to conversations? Representing different but convergent ideas of the sacred, Climate Pieta is an amalgam of such conversations, found footage and AI generated visuals. Bringing forth the intersecting joys, terrors, empathy but also indifference in the face of the biggest challenge mankind has ever faced, Climate Pieta seeks to be a site of prayer, reflections and ultimately taking action.","Abhishek Anupam (India), Pranshu Chaudhary (India), Saransh Sugandh (India)",Meredith Thomas (Germany),https://befantastic.in/together/climate-pieta
5,i call you my kin,i call you my kin,An attempt to redefine the way we perceive the parameters of objects through establishing correlations with characteristics of fungal networks — using the dynamic factors that define the mycelium universe.,/assets/icall_2.png,"As the world continues to be conditioned by anthropocentric perspectives, i call you my kin hopes to present to its audiences new paradigms of sensation by drawing parallels between the manmade and the natural, and in the process draw together a meta-verse of affinities. Incorporating AI and ML, this project is imagined to be an immersive microsite that challenges incumbent worldviews towards provoking kinship with indigenous cultures and non-human systems.","Rebecca G (Singapore); Supported By: Aditi Chauhan (India), Akhil Patil (India), Syahrul Anuar (Singapore)",Harshit Agrawal (India),https://befantastic.in/together/i-call-you-my-kin

The title references a universal symbol for biodiversity and the intricate relationships between all stakeholders within an ecosystem.  The audience is prompted to revise our perspectives on how we might affect it for better or for worse. Above all, it is an invitation to imagine and work towards positively impacting the world around us to build an alternative future that is based on empathy and respect for the web of life.","Divya Ramachandran (India), Gautam Sonti (India), Suresh K.

Through p5.js, ml5 and PoseNet, with.each.drop facilitates a collaboration between performer, audiences and machine to understand our dance with nature and water.",/assets/withe_1.png,"In today’s anthropocentric ecosystem, where we find ourselves increasingly reliant on machinations, battling climate change is a delicate dance. With this in mind, with.each.drop is crafted as an ode to the intricate relationships people around the world have with water. Imagined as an interactive piece that emphasizes humankind’s divergent resonances with rain,  the audience is invited to collaborate with the machine and influence the visual poem’s code through elaborated movement and dance to express climate grief and anxiety.","Ayesha Hassanwalia (India), Cheyenne Alexandria Phillips (Singapore), Hal Rodriguez (USA), Lidya Chrisfens (Singapore), Lisa Botos (Singapore)",Ong Kian Peng (Singapore),https://befantastic.in/together/with-each-drop
9,Stories from your Future,Touring Plaid,An interactive text-based narrative set in 2050 Delhi addressing the crisis of water scarcity. The participant makes difficult choices as they navigate through the story; a provocation to reflect on the climate emergency and the agency we hold today.,/assets/storie_1.png,"Stories from Your Future is an immersive text-based experience where participants navigate through CloudBee - an imagined AI digital governance system, set in 2050 Delhi. It weaves predictive research and location-specific IPCC climate projections into stories, with the participants as co-authors with agency. Ultimately, their choices will collapse into several endings that may be tied to different levels of global warming. Through this, we hope the participants will be in a better position, to not only navigate but also transform the structures that shape what lies ahead.","Matte Lim (Singapore), Srishti Lakhera (India), Swati Simha (India), Vinko Vrsalovic (Spain)",Harshit Agrawal (India),https://befantastic.in/together/stories-from-your-future/

12,The Lost Passage,Group Martha,"The Lost Passage is a digitally reconstructed environment of a swarm of artificial passenger pigeons. Here, they inhabit a destitute memory of a lost landscape while being confined within the four walls of this space.",/assets/thelo_1.png,"In 1914, the passenger pigeon, the most common species of bird on the planet at one point, succumbed to the pressures of a rapidly industrialising world and faced extinction. Through a web browser, the Lost Passage brings its audiences into contact with this long-lost critter in a new ‘habitat’ where its ghosts are virtually caged en masse. Each pigeon that populates this digital landscape acts as a substitute for a real pigeon and navigates a constantly moving environment crafted with machine learning algorithms, evoking a sense of sublime irony at the dual nature of this cage that is self-containing yet suggestive of freedom.","Amay Kataria (USA), Shaohui Kwok (Singapore), Yu-Jeng Kuo (Singapore)",Ong Kian Peng (Singapore),https://befantastic.in/together/the-lost-passage
